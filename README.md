# Reflection üìù

## What I had gain from the visit ‚ú®:
The industry visit presents a valuable opportunity for UTM's students to examine both the internal and external facest of UTM Digital, particularly the services they offer.

From the industry visit, we enable to acquire a deeper understanding of UTM Digital, including its structures and the services it extends to the entire UTM community. Previously, our knowledge was limited to UTM WIFI and myUTM portal. The visit revealed additional services such as UTM ID, UTM SMART application, and the UTM e-learning system, which are vital components they we might not have been aware of without this firsthand experience.  

The visit enhanced students' comprehension and application of Technology and Information System (TIS) course material. Industry especially form Oracle, shared insight into cloud concepts, aligning with the coursework and deepening understanding through a Q&A session.

Students familiarized themselves with various online tools, such as high-tech Huawei screen and high data storage machines, could spark excitement and interest among we as students, fostering a positive attitude towards the technological aspects of their academic environment. These tools, demonstrated during the presentations, are expected to be valuable for information management and future career tasks.

## Improvement üí™:
As improvement suggestion, I would suggest establishing a feedback mechanism and facilitating networking opportunities would contribute to continuous improvement. Establish a feedback mechanism for students to share their thoughts on the industry visit. This input can be valuable for organisers to understand what worked well identify areas for improvement in future visits.

## Others ‚ú®:
Other reflections and creative ideas, I think UTM should hold a similar program on regular basis to guarantee that students can investigate potential career pathways and identify their preferred industries or firms, the organizers should provide invitations to organizations operating in variety of fields.
